    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand what Transform Frames (TFs) are and why they're important\n",
    "- Visualize robot models and TFs in RViz\n",
    "- Create URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files\n",
    "- Connect robot parts with links and joints\n",
    "- Use Xacro to make URDFs more dynamic and maintainable\n",
    "- Package and publish TFs for your robot\n",
    "- Create launch files to start complete robot systems\n",

    "## 🎯 What are Transform Frames (TFs)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transform Frames (TFs)** are one of the most important concepts in ROS. A TF represents the transformation between two coordinate frames in 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need TFs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a mobile robot with:\n",
    "- A base\n",
    "- Two wheels\n",
    "- A camera mounted on top\n",
    "- A lidar sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component needs its own coordinate system (frame). TFs answer questions like:\n",
    "- Where is the camera relative to the robot base?\n",
    "- Where is the left wheel relative to the right wheel?\n",
    "- If the camera detects an object 2 meters away, where is that object relative to the robot's base?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frame**: A 3D coordinate system with an origin and three axes (X, Y, Z)\n",
    "- **Transform**: The translation and rotation needed to go from one frame to another\n",
    "- **TF Tree**: All frames organized in a parent-child hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** In ROS, coordinate systems follow the **right-hand rule**:\n",
    "- **X-axis (red)**: Points forward\n",
    "- **Y-axis (green)**: Points left (90 degrees)\n",
    "- **Z-axis (blue)**: Points up\n",
