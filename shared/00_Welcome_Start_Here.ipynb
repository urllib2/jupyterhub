    "### Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ran `ros2 node list`, you saw several programs running simultaneously. In ROS2, each independent program is called a **node**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot simulator is a node. `robot_state_publisher` is a node. RViz is a node. The `cmd_vel` command you typed created a temporary node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** Nodes never import each other. They don’t know each other exists. Yet they work together perfectly. How?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes communicate through **topics** — named channels where data flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A node that **sends** data to a topic is a **publisher**\n",
    "- A node that **reads** data from a topic is a **subscriber**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you typed the `cmd_vel` command, you became a **publisher** on the `/cmd_vel` topic. The robot simulator was **subscribed** to that topic — it received your command and moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pressed Ctrl+C, the publisher stopped. But the robot simulator kept running — because it’s a completely separate program. It just received zero velocity commands and stopped moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture means:\n",
    "- You can replace any node without touching the others\n",
    "- Multiple nodes can publish to the same topic\n",
    "- Multiple nodes can subscribe to the same topic\n",
    "- Nodes can run on different computers and still communicate\n",
