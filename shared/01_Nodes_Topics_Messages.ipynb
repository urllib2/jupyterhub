    "\n",
    "From your experiments today you discovered:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ A **Node** is an independent process — each does one job\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ A **Topic** is a named channel — nodes communicate without knowing each other\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ A **Message** is a typed data structure — `Twist`, `Odometry`, `LaserScan`\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Publishers and subscribers are completely **decoupled** — add or remove either without touching the other\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ `rqt_graph` shows you the live architecture of any ROS2 system\n",
